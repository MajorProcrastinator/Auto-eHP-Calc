## Auto Calc Usage

* Enter the name of the ship in the box below "Name" (Bulins and Purins are named "Bulin" and "Purin" respectively).
* Append "Kai" to the end of a ship name to get the retrofit stats.
* Click the box below "Level" to get a drop down list for the different levels you can get stats for (100 or 120).
* To change armor modifiers, first the "Enemy Hull Class," then change "Enemy Shell Type." You'll notice a "General" Modifier. This modifier allows you to ignore armor modifiers.
* Changing "Time" allows you to manipulate the health gain from the "Lunchkit" (Repair Tools).
* The "Yes" below "Equipment Skills" represents a toggle. You turn equipment skill calculations off this way. The same can be done for each gear itself.

## Semi-Auto Calc Usage

* Every condition set with the usage of the Auto calculator applies here (Armor Modifier, Automatic Ship Stat Fill-in, Toggles, etc.)
* However, you can change buffs for different synergies and skill combinations,

## Manual Calc Usage
* Same principle as the Semi-Auto Calc, however you must enter things in every stat field for the calculator to work (skills and buffs can be ignored). Some of the cells have drop down boxes, so keep that in mind while using it,
